# GMMK Pro layout

Based on default VIA configuration with some differences for my preferred layout and OS

## Notable features

- VIA support
- 1000 hz polling rate
- Debouncing is eager, with per key delay (20ms by default)
- NKRO enabled by default, toggle off with (<kbd>Fn + N</kbd>)
- RGB power saving (turns off after 3 min of inactivity or when usb is suspended)

## Keymap differences

- Left <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Gui</kbd> are swapped since I'm on macOS
- Keys on the right column are different (<kbd>Delete</kbd> is <kbd>Home</kbd>)
- <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> -> <kbd>Esc</kbd>
- <kbd>Esc</kbd> -> Dedicated macro for cycling through input sources on macOS (<kbd>Command + Option + Space</kbd> by default)
- <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> -> <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>
